# Hacker School

A number of coders get together in a place for some time (say, a month) and hack away at their favorite (or their own) FOSS project. The goal is to become better coders. Learn a new language, or framework. Coders Check in every morning and tell what is happening and how far they are.

The focus is on code, not product; however we work on real projects instead of doing mindless excercises that will never be read or used by anyone.

## Quick hits

* Run school for a limited period
  * Everyone is in (or out) - Not in for only a period
  * Physical location where everyone meets every day
  * Morning check-ins
* Project based
  * Students pick a project - Either already existing FOSS project, or create their own
  * Target language or framework to learn
  * Must be FOSS
* Focus on shipping
* Careful of feature creep
