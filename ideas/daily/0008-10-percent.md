# Giving a tenth away

I read this study that was conducted. I love how it sometimes take a team of scientists to prove the most obvious things in life. What they found, was that if you give a person $100 and tell him to spend it on others, he will be happier than if you give him $100 and tell him to spend it on himself.

I like the study because it proves that giving is a selfish action.

Anyway, it didn't take me much time to combine this, with what I heard they do in some sects: Give 10% of their income to their church or master. If they can do it, so can we. Only we use those 10% in a purely selfish way: We spend them on someone else.

Why don't we?
