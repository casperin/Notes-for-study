# The borders of a society are defined by norms and order

I love the word to be "marginalized". It reminds me of Bauman's theories about how *norm* and *order* defines a society. By definition a soeciety has to be exclusive. If everybody was included, it wouldn't be a society. You couldn't say "us" and refer to a limited group of people.

So by definition you will always have people outside the society. Or "marginalized". You will always have people who don't live up to these norms set by society, and at the other end you will always have people who take pride in punishing these people. They are merely cleaning up. The outliers have shown that they cannot take care of themselves (that is, live up to the norms and order) and thus shouldn't be trusted to take care of themselves.

There is nothing too controversial in all of this. But it is nice to keep in mind, that **by definition** someone has to be on the edge.
