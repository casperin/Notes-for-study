# Knowledge vs Wisdom

I was thinking about wisdom the other day. What strikes me, is that it can't be decoupled from a body &ndash; a person. Even knowledge, defined by Google as "Information and skills acquired through experience or education; the theoretical or practical understanding of a subject", is impossible to remove from a body. You can't write down "understanding", only information.

And so it dawned on me that we aren't really learning anything by reading articles on the web, unless it is applied. I may think I know a lot, but I don't. I just filled my head with information about certain (at times random) topics. I may think I know the right way to do something, but the only basis I have for knowing this, is that either the majority, or the people with the most credit said that it was so. Not because I have seen it with my own eyes.

In such a world, rhetorics become immensely powerful (social media doesn't make it any less powerful either).

I think I'll try an experiment with reading only about something that I want to know more about, based on previous experience. That is, the physical action (can be just a thought) precedes reading about something. I am definitely not saying that everyone should do that&hellip; or even that I should. It's just an experiment to see what happens.
