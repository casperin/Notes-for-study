== Design phases ==

# Start with the actual situation. '''Research''' phase.
#* Go observe users. Talk to them. Who are the players, understand the industry, etc.
#* Observe '''experiences''', not just products (how people use them, etc). Observing products is usability studies.
# '''Analysis''' Make patterns. Understand the theory. Patterns of behavior.
#* Make categories of who you're researching - Everybody should fall into some category
#* Also look at the journey. What are the steps, that a person goes through? ... Where in this journey does each category of people having problems?
# '''Synthesis''' - Come up with ideas. Make plans. Explore concepts.
# '''Prototype & Launch''' - Build stuff. In testing prototypes, we are moving back to the Research phase.


== Research phase ==

* A systematic approach ...  "What are we trying to understand?" <-- Important to have defined

Always bring notebook

* Techniques
** Observe
** Interview
** Ask Users to Self Document
** Conduct Participatory Design Session
** Enact
** Seek Inspiration in New Places

Look for
* '''POEMS''': People, Objects, Environments, Motivations, Systems
* Workarounds (when stuff fails)
* What do they care about?
* Subtleties
