# Sleeping at lectures

I usually sit on second row in big lecture halls. Nobody is sitting on first row, and sitting in second row puts my head on level with the speaker.

The other day, four people *did* sit on first row, and there were even four or five people that placed themselves next to me on second row. So for the first time in a long long time, I was exposed to other people during a lecture.

Of course I didn't know any of them, so nobody was speaking to me; but it was really interesting to watch. I have done some lectures of my own, so I know the amount of preparation that goes into them. Maybe that is why I am such a keen listener at lectures. I bring a notebook to take notes, so I can close the lid on my laptop (if I even brought it). Despite studying at an IT-University, I do believe IT is not the solution to everything.

Honestly, I was appalled by my class mates' actions. They didn't seem to be listening. At one point I even caught all four of the people on first row on facebook at the same time.

The lecture seemed pointless. Why prepare so much and so well when nobody listens? And since they are not listening, maybe they feel there is a better way to study the material?
