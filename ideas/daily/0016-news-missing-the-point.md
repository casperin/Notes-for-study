# Why I don't read the news

There are several reasons. One is, that they continuously seem to miss the point and talk about something that is borderline irrelevant. I am reading this [NYT article about Stuxnet](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/01/world/middleeast/obama-ordered-wave-of-cyberattacks-against-iran.html?_r=1) and I'm amazed at the level of detail they provide, but puzzled by the lack of context.
