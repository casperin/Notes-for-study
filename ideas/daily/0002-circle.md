# The psychological circle you can't get out of

I remember once when I was a kid, the teacher told me I was upset and should calm down. He was right about me being upset. What I was upset about, was his labeling me and having the audacity to order me to "calm down". For a moment, I felt a slight panic. I couldn't get out. The more he persisted that I was behaving irrationally, the more irrationally I behaved. The solution, of course, was to just walk away.

I sometimes think about the people who can't just walk away. Those who gets medicated when they aren't behaving. What do they do?
