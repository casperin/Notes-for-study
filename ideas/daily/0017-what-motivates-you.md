# What motivates you?

I wonder if most of us are just "work horses". By that I mean that we only feel good if we are of some use. If we are productive.

Whenever I travel for long periods of time, I inevitably get a feeling of being useless, and I dislike it. So to me, it is not controversial or surprising that people wants to work. But lately, I have been wondering, if there is another motivator. A motivator much stronger, or even -- dare I say it? -- better. It is curiosity. It leads to play, not work (in the traditional sense of the word at least).

I think those who go on to do great things, has curiosity as their greatest inspiration. They want to experiment and learn. To play. They are curious about their work and creations. Not just trying to figure out how to make it better, but curious about all its aspects.
