# The ideals that stole our time

I was walking past buildings in Copenhagen with my fianc√© the other day. We were struck by how much attention was paid to the old buildings compared to later ones. The same goes for trainstations. We are so much richer now, but we don't have time for details? Where did the time go? Did [grey men with bowler hats steal it](http://www.amazon.com/Momo-Michael-Ende/dp/0140079165)?

I want a turtle.

Seriously though. The obvious answer is that we are more and more busy with keeping up. We are social creatures and, as [Durkheim points out](http://www.deathreference.com/Da-Em/Durkheim-mile.html), after moving into cities and by that losing our identity in family and profession (which is why we have many more suicides in urban environments), the only real way to define ourselves, is by what we wear and what we own. Of course people will compete for getting to the top. Flatter is form of pseudo love, and even pseudo love is better than nothing in an ever more anonymous (urbanized) world.

Of course this behavior doesn't make us any happier.
