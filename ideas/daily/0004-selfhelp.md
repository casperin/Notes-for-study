# Why do people like self-help books?

I sometimes read them out of curiosity. I regret it every time. I feel the books are speaking to me as if I was a child. I wonder what makes people read them, love them, advocate them, discuss them, argue for or against them (mostly for them it seems).

I think it is because they confirm what they already know. Just like we naturally tend to like people who hold the same opinions as ourselves, I imagine we tend to like books that agree with us. We can sit and nod in our chair or bed and feel good about getting acknowledged in our wisdom.
