# It's important that you thought about it

I don't care if you smoke or not. I don't care if you eat animals or not. If you drink beer or watch 8 hours of TV every day. It's all fine by me.

What I do care about is that you made the conscious choice to do whatever you are doing. That your choices are reasonable&mdash;to you.
