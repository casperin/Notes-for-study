# Less not Simpler

I want less things in my life. Less stuff that demands my attention. But I want the things that I keep in my life to be so important, and so interesting, and so complex, that they deserve my attention.

This thinking comes from the realization that nothing is simple. In fact, everything is immensely complex. It has a depth to it that we can't imagine unless we devote our lives to it.

By always focusing on making everything simpler, I fear that we are dumbing ourselves down. We want friends, but we don't want them to be complicated human beings with real feelings. We want to be good, nay "great", at something; but we wish that something wasn't so incredibly difficult to learn.

I somehow find it less important to be on the top of everything, and more important to be on the bottom at something.
