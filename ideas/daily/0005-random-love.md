# Our one true love is random

Few people would admit to loving a random person. But really, it could have been almost anyone. We fall in love and marry (I suppose) when we are ready to do so. It's about us, not about the other person.

No, I think what is much less random and in a way, much more important, is our work. Our craft. This is not random. I believe it is something we feel a much stronger call for.

... I wonder what would happen if we flipped the hours we spend nurturing our love and the hours we work.
