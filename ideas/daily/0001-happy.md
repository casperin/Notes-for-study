# The happiest person on the planet

... is me. Or it might be at least. I'm not using “me” in the general meaning of its use. I don't mean you, the reader. I mean me, the author of this little piece.

In fact I am not entirely sure why you are even reading this, or why you should care. Maybe you can derive something from it. Maybe it helps you look at your own life as being not so bad (or maybe you realise that compared to my life, yours stinks). I don't know.

What I do know, is that comparing happiness levels makes very little sense, and I won't get into that right now. The statement — that I'm the happiest person on this planet — is based on general observations and on what I have read on the subject.

  1. **I live in Denmark.** I live in the country that according to studies have the happiest people. Of course this doesn't guarantee my happiness, but it's the best start I could ask for.

  2. **I am healthy.** No really. I have tried being ill, and being healthy is so much better.

  3. **Healthy Work/life balance.** What is it? It's more or less what I chose it to be. My 8 hours “work day” is roughly devided thus: 50% studying, 45% working on my own project, and 5% working for money.

  My own project doesn't give any money yet, but 1) It's a great learning experience, 2) It looks awesome on my CV (especially since we got a lot of big websites praising us), and 3) It's a lot of fun with some very intelligent people!

  If we take the SDT model for happiness (by Deci and Ryan), then this covers the *autonomy* area. I have a great portion of autonomy in my life, which is one of the three pillars for being happy. (The other two being “competency”, and “relatedness”).

  4. **I “found” what I'm passionate about.** I'm not a believer in finding such things, but rather working towards them. I believe that the best way to search, is to get your hands dirty — really dirty.

  Either way, I did that. I got it. And I'm now taking a masters in it, and getting paid to work wth it. I'm still unsure about the exact direction, but it will come the more I study and work with the subject.

  I also teach this subject at university level (officially I'm only a TA, but my generous professor has allowed me to give lectures on topics where I'm more knowledgable than he is), so going back to the SDT model, you can say that I certainly feel *competent* at what I do.

  5. **I am educated.** I am 30 years old, and I have been studying since I was 6. I don't always finish the education I start (I don't always finish the books I start either...), but I have way above average education, and in completely different fields too.

  The masters I am currently doing, is on design, so having studied a variation of topics (chemical engineering, teaching, math, history, political science, literature, frontend development) is suddenly a huge benefit for me.

  6. **I have seen the world.** If I was king, then it would be mandatory after you graduate from school, to get a job to get some money, and go see the world for one year.

  The things you learn from this, cannot be put into tiny paragraphs. If you have done it yourself, then you know what I am talking about. If you haven't, then you probably don't.

  7. **I don't need much.** I can't stress the importance of this enough. I learned this from travelling to poor countries, and from thinking and reading. I have seen people be happy living from basically nothing. I have even joined them for some tme, and felt it on my own body.

  Also I was not very old when I first time realised the relativity of what it takes to make us happy. You only really need to know that people in rich countries commit suicide too to understand this. Wealth doesn't buy you happiness. But if wealth doesn't, then what does? And why are we so focused on it? Maybe if we get used to not having much, we don't need to work so much to pay for all of it, which will give us more time to create a good life (which ironically may mean a life dedicated to work).

  8. **I'm an optimist.** I live in Denmark, the happiest country in the world. But even living here, I feel I am the happiest person I know. I am trying to think about the people I know and interact with; and even though none of them seem particularly sad, I seem to have a more positive outlook on life than any of them do.

  9. **Distance to work.** I read somewhere, that the worst time during our day, is while we commute. Having lived 2 hours away from my university and job I will agree with this. 8 hours work day + 4 hours of commute does not leave you a lot of room for yourself.

  Half a year ago, I decided to take this seriously; and moved back to Denmark and close to where I study and work (5 and 20 minutes on bike respectively).

  This is probably the *single best decision* I made in terms of improving the quality of my life. If you are serious about wanting to improve the quality of your life, makes sure to get this one right.

  10. **I bike... everywhere.** First of all I am very grateful for living in a city that really does all it can to improve life for bicyclists, it really does make my life so much easier. Second, I am really puzzled by the amount of excuses people will give me for not using their bike. They don't need to give me any excuses at all. They are depriving themselves — not me — of something so good. Maybe it's because they know that I will be paying their medical bills when they get old and feeble because all the exercise they did, was walking to and from their car.

  11. **I exercise.** How much? Depends. Right now I'm doing a bit of experimentation, so I am lifting weights 7 days of the week. And of course, again, I bike everywhere.

  Previously I have been an avid climber (bouldering mostly), and doing a lot of capoeira.

  12. **I have good friends and family.** I do, I really do. And I'm even starting to appreciate them. I haven't always been very good at this (still am not), but I'm getting there. I love the people I work with, I love my students (whom are mostly older than I am), I love my personal friends and appreciate how my social network is slowly (oh so slowly) but surely growing, and I love my tiny family.

  13. **I'm empathic.** Everyone luckily is. Am I more empathic than others? I think I am. Often I will be talking to a friend, and laughing at something stupid they or I did. We all do stupid things. In fact I think it's one of the most human traits we can have.

  Another fact is that I forgive very easily. People cheat me and abuse my good will, but I don't really mind. I am optimistic, but not as such naïve. I know people can, and will, do these things, but I choose to help anyway. An example of that is that I host a lot of people from CouchSurfing(.org), and I have on more than one occation given my house key to total strangers and told them to just drop it in the mail box in the morning when they leave. I am aware they could take all my stuff (Not that I have a lot), and do horrible things to my apartment. But I choose to give them the key anyway. I have been enriched by so many people from this, that even if I can home to a ruined apartment tomorrow, I would still not regret having done it.

  14. **I am aware that my life is good.** From the research I have read on this “happiness” topic, one thing stands out quite clear: You need to be reminded of the good things in your life. If you don't, you will grow accustumed to them and start taking them for granted.

  This is of course not black or white. It's not a) either you're completely aware of your life being good, or b) You're oblivious to the fact. But I do I feel I am very much aware of it. Again, the reasons are many. I travelled a lot, so I think I have a pretty realistic picture of what to reasonably expect from life. I also used to teach 16-18 year olds, and they would often lament on their life. “What life would you rather have?” I used to ask. “In what country, by what parents, would you rather have been born?”

  That said, I think I might have something still to learn here. I am not actively seeking out thinking about, or remind myself of, the happiest things in my life.

  15. **I experiment a lot.** This is the first thing people notice about me. I'm in the middle of some kind of experiment. They follow a simple formula: “Do something you suspect might lead to something interesting, and see what happens.” I do them for me, so I don't care what everyone else thinks about them. Right now I have two going on: 1) What will happen to my body if I lift weights every day? Can the body adapt to cope with it? What happens to my mood levels, and my life in general? Do I study harder? Work harder? More focused? Less focused? And 2) Find out how little money I can survive on, while still having the great life that I have.

  Both require extreme descipline. I need to show up at the gym every day, and I need to prepare my own food, and keep track of every penny I spend.

  My experimentations rarely have a fixed time span, and they certainly do not have a fixed, or even expected, outcome. If I know exactly what will happen and how things will go, then there is no reason to perform the experiment. Then I am not learning anything new from it.

  Other previous experiments: How little do I need in a room to still feel at home there? And can I pass an exam studying only two hours a day for two weeks before it? (What makes this one interesting is that this ended up being my best exam).

  Experimentation takes a lot of time. Not during the day, but they run over a long period of time. Usually months. That's why running multiple at the same time makes sense. Future experiments include something about meditation, something about the speed of learning, something about not multitasking, writing a diary, and something about reading books, a lot of them.

  16. **I choose how I view things.** The little that I have read self-help books and guides, this seems to come up a lot, and I actually agree that this is a big source of contentment if mastered.

  It's about getting to the core of yourself, and realise that ultimately you decide in what light you view things, and how you react to, and even feel about, them. A friend told me a short story that exemplified this very well: A guy is feeling sad and misserable about himself. He has been for some time. One day he wakes up and thinks to himself “I don't like myself”. He then realises that there is more to him, than just this person feeling depressed. Who is the “I” in that sentence? Who is it that doesn't like himself? (She told me this story the first time we met... deep!)

  I don't want to say that I mastered this, but I certainly have come a long way. It's hard for me to give examples from my life, but I think without this, I wouldn't be able to do all those experiments. I would be whining about having to prepare food yet again, or going to the gym.

  I never lose my temper. Never. If I get angry, then it's usually a very calculated move because it's the only way I can see achieving something.


  17. **I get ample sleep.** I make sure I get the sleep I need. In fact I usually sleep until I can't sleep any longer.

  When I first time was hired to do mental work on a daily basis, I realised that I could not work to the best of my ability if I had not gotten the sleep I needed, which meant I was depriving my employer of what he paid me for. So, typically me, I started an experiment on sleep; and not too surprisingly (in retrospect) I did more harm than good at work, if I had slept less than 6 hours. On those days everyone would have been better off, had I stayed home.

  There are also lots of research done into what happens to immune and stress levels and such when you deprive yourself of sleep. But really, it all just comes down to feeling better during the day.The happiest person on the planet
