# The information overload came on a weekend with no internet

My fianc√© and I recently took a weekend without our laptops. I mean, they were there; we were just not allowed to use them.

The details aren't important, but it was the weekend we both got struck with information overload. Or at least it felt that way. Not being numbed down with endless streams of information (usually in the form of online articles about various interesting topics), my brain started thinking for itself.

Painful. Yet liberating.

I'm guessing it's the opposite though. That we live in a constant overload of information. So much, we can't get a chance to think for ourselves.
