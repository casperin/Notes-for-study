# I am different than you

One way to define ourselves, is through our differences. On one hand we wish to belong to a group, on the other we wish to be independent and different.

I wonder if that is one of the reasons people have to point out "flaws" in others. Because they have a need to define where they stand, where they are different.

&hellip; Another reason, I guess, is just to learn from others' mistakes.
