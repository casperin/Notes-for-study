# The meaning of art

I rarely go to art museums, but a few weeks ago I did go. I went to see some modern art exhibition, and on the way in picked up a piece of paper explaining what the exhibition was about. At first I walked around trying to get whatever I could from the tiny exhibition without any prior knowledge or prejudice. And I could see in the faces of other people that they were doing the same. Puzzled faces all around. A lot left almost in frustration it seemed.

I then read the paper and everything started to make sense. I was lucky that it was an exhibition consisting of installations from three different artists exploring three different themes or motives, because it immediately became clear to me, that some of it I liked, and some I didn't like (or perhaps didn't understand).

I wonder, if someone who is good at understanding art, is good because he doesn't need to read the information about the exhibitions, or if he's good because he reads it very thoroughly before he enters.

Either way, I might start enjoying art exhibitions if I actually read what they were about.
