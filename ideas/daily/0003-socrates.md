# When beauty is right and Socrates wrong

A friend of mine briefly reminded me of the Sophists yesterday. How they could argue in favour of just about anything using the most absurd logical conclusions. It reminded me of how I sometimes feel about Socrates. I have a lot of respect for the old man, but I can surely understand his contemporaries' anger towards him. Sometimes, what feels right *is* right. Sometimes, what is beautiful is right.

Nietzsche pointed out his flaws very well. Nietzsche did not (as Socrates did) question whether something was right or wrong. He asked if it was part of life. If it was natural. If it was beautiful. If it was powerful and strong. To him, might was right. He is often explained as being a nihilist because he did not believe in any Gods, but it is wrong to label him as such. He believed in *life*. Socrates was searching for what is right, what is true. To him truth was above all. Nietzsche questioned our assumption that truth is inherently better than lie. Life is full of lies, he said. We need lies to live. If you are faced with two options: what is true and what is fale; then you can't just assume that the truth is good and what is false is bad. You have to dig deeper, and ask if it helps promote life.

I've heard the story, that Niels Bohr (Danish physisist) once claimed that the opposite of truth is love. His rationale, was the story of how he - full of love for his niece - had agreed that her doll (broken and torn) was indeed beautiful.

If you have perfect justice, then you can't have growth. Life comes to a standstill. What is natural does not ask if something is just. Love does not care about morality.
